FeedLister
==========

FeedLister is an OPML reading library written in .NET.
Although it follows the OPML specs (available [1.0 here](http://dev.opml.org/spec1.html) and [2.0 here](http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html)) it was written for the specific purpose of reading OPML documents for RSS readers.
The library will follow the spec, but will need some work to make it really flexible for use with custom OPML elements.

This library is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
